# UAV Rail Inspection
Method for the automated inspection of a rail section. 

**important:** The repo does not contains the weights

## How to install it
This is a ROS package (ROS noetic), you can install it just like a normal ros package

## How to build your model
To train your model, and download the correspondant weights you can use my colab notebook:

## Test
All the test were carried out with Mavic2 enterprise dual UAV and in simulation ( with CoppeliaSim ).

## Info
This repository contains Robotics Operating Systems (ROS) packages for the algorithm implementation and uses Detectron2 for rail detection.

 - Detectron2: <https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2> (released under the Apache 2.0 license)
 - ROS: <https://www.ros.org/>
 
The repo also contains scripts for data augmentation operations and video generation from frame collections.
 
## Note
This repo is part of my master thesis project, for more info see the correspondant chapter of the written paper.
